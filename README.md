# Memory Card Game

This is a memory card game that can help your memory and prevent dementia. The memory game consists of pairs of cards with identical emojis. If a match is found, the cards stay flipped, if not, they will turn back. The game continues until all cards are flipped.

## This project

## Challenges
- this was the first time that I used flexbox and grid in a real project
- a lot of bugs that are no longer in the code
- JavaScrript - I am still a beginner when it comes to JavaScript
